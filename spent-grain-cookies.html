    <p>After making my spent grain flour last weekend, I was simply aching to get some baking in with it - not to mention the friends bugging me to make them. I decided on the <a href="http://brooklynbrewshop.com/themash/recipe-spent-grain-peanut-butter-cookies/">Spent Grain Peanut Butter Cookies</a>, recipe courtesy of <a href="http://brooklynbrewshop.com/">Brooklyn Brew Shop</a>'s <a href="http://brooklynbrewshop.com/themash">The Mash</a>.</p>

<p>Upon mixing the ingredients, I was convinced the batter needed water, or milk, or maybe another egg. The consistency was just all wrong, but I decided to trust the recipe and forged ahead.</p>
<p><img alt="Batter" src="" title="{static}images/images/2014-07-28-batter.jpg"></p>
<p>Success! Now to just make the cookies - this was going decievingly easy. And did I mention this was a double batch? There would be more cookies than we knew what to do with - fortunately I had some social events coming up, not to mention coworkers more than willing to 'help out.'</p>
<p>Once the cookies were all properly aligned on the sheets (and it took two rounds in the oven), I grabbed a fork to do the cross-hatch on the tops. Unfortunately, my silverware is real silver, and has tiny prongs, so I didn't get the gorgeous results like Brooklyn Brew Shop did, but that didn't make them taste any less good.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I haven't gotten any good photos of the finished product, as they came out of the oven just as it was time to head to bed, and the next few days I was knocked out by my latest case of Strep Throat. Fortunately I'm now on the up-turn, but not enough so that I want to risk infecting the batch. Once I'm a few days further past, I'll try to get a photo - assuming they aren't all gone.</p>
