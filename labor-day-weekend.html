    <p>It's a three-day weekend, and what does that mean? Well, probably getting sick, because the universe is cruel. But that aside, it's actually been quite a relaxing one - we had D&amp;D on Saturday, and shortly before I discovered a <em>very</em> cool React project called <a href="https://dukeflipchart.github.io/dndspells/">The Spells of D&amp;D 5e</a>. It was <em>almost</em> perfect... and hey, I've never played with React before, so why not give it a spin?</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Backing up a bit - I'm a visualization nerd. Before landing completely in software engineering, I had planned to blend graphic design and programming, two things I'd fallen in love with as a kid.</p>
<p>So here I am, poking at my news feed on Saturday morning, and this <em>absolutely gorgeous</em> interactive infographic shows up. What's a girl to do? Share it with the rest of her nerdy friends, of course.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before I poked at the source code. From what I could initially see (despite knowing absolutely nothing of node.js or React), <a href="http://github.com/dukeflipchart">dukeflipchart</a> had started with a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a>, interleaved some specific logic, and integrated the JSON he generated via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2qs89e/5e_spell_reference_sheets_are_done/">u/Zolo49's spell spreadsheet</a>. He's got a pretty solid explanation of the process on the original page; check it out if you're interested.</p>
<p>Personally, I wanted to get my hands dirty, so in my Chromebook fashion, I spun up a Codenvy NodeJS project, forked his project, imported it, and got to poking. The scaffolding for leveling, which felt like a really obvious additional filter to be made available.</p>
<p>The biggest changes to make were:
- Add another <code>HighlightLabel</code> section for the levels
- Add functionality for the new section's <code>onClick</code> behavior
- Change the <code>getHighlightColors</code> logic to consider both the casters and the levels
- Update the logic behind <code>hasOpacity</code></p>
<p>That last one took <em>way</em> longer than I'd like to admit. I probably spent a couple hours going in circles, trying to find why logic in one place was behaving so different from another place. While I'm tempted to blame the sick on this, realistically, I just don't know the frameworks being used here, so a lot of the more implicit things (such as these seemingly arbitrary property names) just weren't clicking for me.</p>
<p>Sleeping on it seemed to do the trick - when I looked again this morning, tracing line for line, I finally spotted it, and it was such an easy change, it was embarrassing. But it was finished, so all that was left to figure out was publishing to Github-pages, which <em>should</em> have been easy, except it took me a while more flailing to figure out the right way to get npm to use my personal access token.</p>
<p>Finally, though, it's here - <a href="https://jenrsparks.github.io/dndspells/">The Spells of D&amp;D 5E</a>.</p>
<p>After spamming the same nerdy friends, a couple items were flagged for possible improvements:
- Linking to spell descriptions / details
- Additional classes added</p>
<p>The former should be easy, and the latter... well, as <a href="http://github.com/dukeflipchart">dukeflipchart</a> said, it's time consuming. But maybe worth it.</p>
